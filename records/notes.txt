how frequency data is calculated in web audio api
https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#current-frequency-data

how bin width is calculated in general (time series sample frequency is 44100 hz)
http://support.ircam.fr/docs/AudioSculpt/3.0/co/FFT%20Size.html

resulting binwidth is 21.5

####
sample_1 features a chromatic scale
scale starts around slice 390~ continues to slice 900~
frequency starts at E81 ends 28 steps later at 81*4*2^(4/12)=432 or 19.4
